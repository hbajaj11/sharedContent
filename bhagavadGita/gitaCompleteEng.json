          "Dhrtarastra said: Sanjaya, gathered on the holy  land of Kuruksetra, eager to fight, what did my  sons and the sons of Pandu do? (1)",
          "Sanjaya said: At that time, seeing the army of  the Pandavas drawn up for battle and approaching  Dronacarya, King Duryodhana spoke the following words : (2)",
          "Behold, O Revered Master, the mighty army  of the sons of Pandu arrayed for battle by your  talented pupil. Dhrstadyumna, son of Drupada. (3)",
          "There are in this army, heroes wielding mighty  bows and equal in military prowess to Bhlma and  Arjuna—Satyaki and Virata and the MaharathI  (warrior chief) Drupada;(4)",
          "Dhrstaketu, Cekitana and  the valiant King of KasT, and Purujit. Kuntibhoja,  and Saibya, the best of men (5)",
          "and mighty  Yudhamanyu, and valiant Uttamauja, Abhimanyu,  the son of Subhadra, and the five sons of Draupadi—  all of them Maharathls (warrior chiefs). (6)",
          "O best of Brahmanas, know them also who are  the principal warriors on our side— the generals  of my army. For your information I mention them. (7)",
          "“Yourself and Bhisma and Kama and Krpa, who  is ever victorious in battle; and even so Asvatthama,  Vikarna and Bhurisrava (the son of Somadatta); (8)",
          "And there are many other heroes, all skilled in  warfare equipped with various weapons and  missiles, who have staked their lives for me.(9)",
          "This army of ours, fully protected by Bhisma,  is unconquerable; while that army of theirs, guarded  in everyway by Bhima, is easy to conquer. (10)",
          "Therefore, stationed in your respective positions  on all fronts, do you all guard Bhisma in particular  on all sides. (11)",
          "The grand old man of the Kaurava race, their  glorious grand-patriarch Bhisma, cheering up  Duryodhana, roared terribly like a lion and blew his conch. (12)",
          "Then conches, kettledrums, tabors, drums and  trumpets blared forth all at once and the noise was tumultuous. (13)",
          "Then, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by  white horses, Sri Krsna as well as Arjuna blew  their celestial conches. (14)",
          "Sri Krsna blew His conch named Pancajanya;  Arjuna, Devadatta; while Bhlma of ferocious deeds  blew his mighty conch Paundra. (15)",
          "King Yudhisthira, son of KuntI, blew his conch  Anantavijaya, while Nakula and Sahadeva blew  theirs, known as Sughosa and Manipuspaka  respectively. (16)",
          "And the excellent archer, the King of Kasi, and  Sikhandi the Maharathi (the great chariot-warrior),  Dhrstadyumna and Virata, and invincible Satyaki(17)",
          "Drupada as well as the five sons of DraupadI, and  the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra,  all of them, O lord of the earth, severally blew their respective conches from all sides. (18)",
          "And the terrible sound, echoing through heaven  and earth, rent the hearts of Dhrtarastra's army. (19)",
          "Now, O lord of the earth, seeing your sons  arrayed against him and when missiles were ready  to be hurled, Arjuna, who had the figure of  Hanuman on the flag of his chariot, took up his  bow and then addressed the following words to  Sri Krsna; (20)",
          "\"Krsna, place my chariot between the two armies. (21)",
          "\"And keep it there till I have carefully observed  these warriors drawn up for battle, and have seen  with whom I have to engage in this fight. (22)",
          "\"I shall have a look at the well-wishers of evil-  minded Duryodhana, in this war whoever have  assembled on his side and are ready for the fight.”(23)",
          "Sanjaya said: O king, thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krsna placed the magnificent chariot between the two armies(24)",
          "in front of Bhlsma, Drona and all  the kings and said, “Arjuna. behold these Kauravas assembled here.\" (25)",
          "Now Arjuna saw stationed there in both the  armies his uncles, grand-uncles and teachers, even  great grand-uncles, maternal uncles, brothers and  cousins, sons and nephews, and grand-nephews,  even so friends, fathers-in-law and well-wishers  as well. (26 &amp; first half of 27)",
          "Seeing all the relations present there, Arjuna  was overcome with deep compassion and spoke  thus in sorrow. (Second half of 27 and first half of 28)",
          "",
          "Arjuna said: Krsna, as I see these kinsmen arrayed  for battle, my limbs give way, and my mouth is  getting parched; nay, a shiver runs through my body  and hair stands on end. (Second half of 28 and 29)",
          "The bow, Gandlva, slips from my hand and  my skin too burns all over; my mind is whirling, as it were, and I can no longer hold myself steady. (30)",
          "And, Kesava, I see omens of evil, nor do I see  any good in killing my kinsmen in battle. (31)",
          "Krsna, I do not covet victory, nor kingdom,  nor pleasures. Govinda, of what use will kingdom  or luxuries or even life be to us! (32)",
          "Those very persons for whose sake we covet  the kingdom, luxuries and pleasures(33)",
          "teachers,  uncles, sons and nephews and even so, grand uncles and great grand-uncles, maternal uncles,  fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law and  other relations-are here arrayed on the battlefield  staking their lives and wealth. (34)",
          "O Slayer of Madhu, I do not want to kill them,  though they may slay me, even for the sovereignty  over the three worlds; how much the less for  the kingdom here on earth! (35)",
          "Krsna, how can we hope to be happy slaying  the sons of Dhrtarastra; by killing even these  desperadoes, sin will surely accrue to us. (36)",
          "Therefore, Krsna, it does not behove us to kill  our relations, the sons of Dhrtarastra. For, how can  we be happy after killing our own kinsmen? (37)",
          "Even though these people, with their mind  blinded by greed, perceive no evil in destroying  their own race and no sin in treason to friends,  why should not we(38)",
          "O Krsna. who see clearly  the sin accruing from the destruction of one’s  family, think of desisting from committing this  sin. (39)",
          "Age-long family traditions disappear with the  destruction of a family; and virtue having been  lost, vice takes hold of the entire race. (40)",
          "With the preponderance of vice, Krsna, the  women of the family become corrupt; and with  the corruption of women, O descendant of Vrsni,  there ensues an intermixture of castes. (41)",
          "Progeny owing to promiscuity damns the  destroyers of the race as well as the race itself.  Deprived of the offerings of rice and water (Sraddha, Tarpana etc.,) the manes of their race also fall. (42)",
          "Through these evils bringing about an  intermixture of castes, the age-long caste traditions  and family customs of the killers of kinsmen get  extinct. (43)",
          "Krsna, we hear that men who have lost their  family traditions, dwell in hell for an indefinite  period of time. (44)",
          "Oh what a pity! Though possessed of intelligence  we have set our mind on the commission of a  great sin; that due to lust for throne and enjoyment  we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. (45)",
          "It would be better for me if the sons of  Dhrtarastra, armed with weapons, kill me in battle,  while I am unarmed and unresisting. (46)",
          "Sanjaya said: Arjuna, whose mind was agitated  by grief on the battlefield, having spoken thus,  and having cast aside his bow and arrows, sank  into the hinder part of his chariot. (47)"

          "Sanjaya said: Sri Krsna then addressed the  following words to Arjuna, who was, as mentioned  before, overwhelmed with pity, whose eyes were  filled with tears and agitated, and who was full  of sorrow. (1)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : Arjuna, how has this  infatuation overtaken you at this odd hour? It is  shunned by noble souls; neither will it bring  heaven, nor fame to you. (2)",
          "Yield not to unmanliness, Arjuna; this does  not become you. Shaking off this base faint¬  heartedness stand-up, O scorcher of enemies.(3)",
          "Arjuna said : How Krsna, shall I fight Bhlsma  and Drona with arrows on the battlefield? They  are worthy of deepest reverence, O destroyer of  foes. (4)",
          "It is better to live on alms in this world by not  slaying these noble elders, because even after  killing them we shall after all enjoy only  bloodstained pleasures in the form of wealth and  sense-enjoyments. (5)",
          "We do not even know which is preferable for  us—to fight or not to fight; nor do we know whether  we shall win or whether they will conquer us. Those  very sons of Dhrtarastra, killing whom we do not  even wish to live, stand in the enemy ranks. (6)",
          "With my very being smitten by the vice of  faint-heartedness and my mind puzzled with regard  to duty, I beseech You! tell me that which is  decidedly good; I am your disciple. Pray, instruct  me, who have taken refuge in You. (7)",
          "For, even on obtaining undisputed sovereignty  and an affluent kingdom on this earth and lordship  over the gods, I do not see any means that  can drive away the grief which is drying up my  senses. (8)",
          "Sanjaya said : O King, having thus spoken  to Sri Krsna, Arjuna again said to Him, “I will  not fight,” and became silent. (9)",
          "Then, O Dhrtarastra, Sri Krsna, as if smiling,  addressed the following words to Arjuna, sorrowing  in the midst of the two armies. (10)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: Arjuna, you grieve over  those who should not be grieved for and yet speak  like the learned; wise men do not sorrow over the  dead or the living. (11)",
          "In fact, there was never a time when I was not,  or when you or these kings were not. Nor is it a  fact that hereafter we shall all cease to be. (12)",
          "Just as boyhood, youth and old age are  attributed to the soul through this body, even so  it attains another body. The wise man does not  get deluded about this. (13)",
          "O son of Kunti, the contacts between the senses  and their objects, which give rise to the feelings of  heat and cold, pleasure and pain etc., are transitory  and fleeting; therefore, Arjuna, endure them. (14)",
          "Arjuna, the wise man to whom pain and pleasure  are alike, and who is not tormented by these  contacts, becomes eligible for immortality. (15)",
          "The unreal has no existence, and the real never  ceases to be; the reality of both has thus been  perceived by the seers of Truth. (16)",
          "Know that alone to be imperishable which  pervades this universe; for no one has power to  destroy this indestructible substance. (17)",
          "All these bodies pertaining to the imperishable,  indefinable and eternal soul are spoken of as  perishable; therefore, Arjuna, fight. (18)",
          "Both of them are ignorant, he who considers the  soul to be capable of killing and he who takes it as  killed; for verily the soul neither kills, nor is killed. (19)",
          "The soul is never bom, nor it ever dies; nor  does it become after being born. For. it is unborn,  eternal, everlasting and primeval; even though  the body is slain, the soul is not. (20)",
          "Arjuna, the man who knows this soul to be  imperishable; eternal and free from birth and  decay—how and whom will he cause to be killed,  how and whom will he kill? (21)",
          "As a man shedding worn-out garments, takes  other new ones, likewise, the embodied soul, casting  off worn-out bodies, enters into others that are  new. (22)",
          "Weapons cannot cut it nor can fire burn it;  water cannot wet it nor can wind dry it. (23)",
          "For this soul is incapable of being cut, or burnt  by fire; nor can it be dissolved by water and is undriable  by air as well; This soul is eternal, all-pervading,  immovable, constant and everlasting. (24)",
          "This soul is unmanifest; it is incomprehensible  and it is spoken of as immutable. Therefore,  knowing it as such, you should not grieve. (25)",
          "And, Arjuna, if you should suppose this soul  to be subject to constant birth and death, even  then you should not grieve like this. (26)",
          "For, in that case death is certain for the born,  and rebirth is inevitable for the dead. You should  not, therefore, grieve over the inevitable. (27)",
          "Arjuna, before birth beings are not manifest to  our human senses; on death they return to the  unmanifest again. They are manifest only in the  interim between birth and death. What occasion,  then, for lamentation? (28)",
          "Hardly any great soul perceives this soul as  marvellous, scarce another great soul likewise  speaks thereof as marvellous, and scarce another  worthy one hears of it as marvellous, while there are  some who know it not even on hearing of it.(29)",
          "Arjuna, this soul dwelling in the bodies of  all, can never be slain; therefore, you should not  mourn for anyone. (30)",
          "Besides, considering your own duty too, you  should not waver, for there is nothing more  welcome for a man of the warrior class than a  righteous war. (31)",
          "Arjuna, fortunate are the Ksatriyas who get such  an unsolicited opportunity for war, which is an  open gateway to heaven. (32)",
          "Now, if you refuse to fight this righteous war,  then, shirking your duty and losing your reputation,  you will incur sin. (33)",
          "Nay, people will also pour undying infamy on  you; and infamy brought on a man enjoying  popular esteem is worse than death. (34)",
          "And the warrior-chiefs who thought highly of  you, will now despise you, thinking that it was  fear which drove you away from battle. (35)",
          "And your enemies, disparaging your might, will  speak many unbecoming words; what can be more  distressing than this? (36)",
          "Die, and you will win heaven; conquer, and  you enjoy sovereignty of the earth; therefore, stand  up, Arjuna, determined to fight. (37)",
          "Treating alike victory and defeat, gain and  loss, pleasure and pain, get ready for the battle;  fighting thus you will not incur sin. (38)",
          "Arjuna, this attitude of mind has been presented   to you from the point of view of Jnanayoga; now  hear the same as presented from the standpoint of  Karmayoga (the Yoga of selfless action). Equipped  with this attitude of mind, you will be able to  throw off completely the shackles of Karma. (39)",
          "In this path (of selfless action) there is no loss  of effort, nor is there fear of contrary result, even  a little practice of this discipline saves one from  the terrible fear of birth and death. (40)",
          "Arjuna, in this Yoga (of selfless action) the  intellect is determinate and directed singly towards  one ideal; whereas the intellect of the undecided  (ignorant men moved by desires) wanders in all  directions after innumerable aims. (41)",
          "Arjuna, those who are full of worldly desires and  devoted to the letter of the Vedas, who look upon  heaven as the supreme goal and argue that there  is nothing beyond heaven, are unwise.(42)",
          "They utter  flowery speech recommending many rituals of various  kinds for the attainment of pleasure and power with  rebirth as their fruit.(43)",
          "Those whose minds are carried  away by such words, and who are deeply attached  to pleasures and worldly power, cannot attain the  determinate intellect concentrated on God. (44)",
          "Arjuna, the Vedas thus deal with the evolutes  of the three Gunas (modes of Prakrti), viz., worldly  enjoyments and the means of attaining such enjoy¬  ments; be thou indifferent to these enjoyments and  their means, rising above pairs of opposites like  pleasure and pain etc., established in the Eternal  Existence (God), absolutely unconcerned about the  fulfilment of wants and the preservation of what has  been already attained, you be self-controlled.(45)",
          "A Brahmana, who has obtained enlightenment,  has as much use for all the Vedas as one who  stands at the brink of a sheet of water overflowing  on all sides has for a small reservoir of water. (46)",
          "Your right is to work only and never to the fruit  thereof. Do not Consider yourself to be the cause of the  fruit of action; nor let your attachment be to inaction. (47)",
          "Arjuna, perform your duties established in  Yoga, renouncing attachment, and be even-minded  in success and failure; evenness of mind is  called ‘Yoga’. (48)",
          "Action with a selfish motive is far inferior to  this Yoga in the form of equanimity. Do seek refuge  in this equipoise of mind, Arjuna; for poor and  wretched are those who are the cause in making  their actions bear fruit. (49)",
          "Endowed with equanimity, one sheds in this  life both good and evil. Therefore, strive for the  practice of this Yoga of equanimity. Skill in action  lies in the practice of this Yoga. (50)",
          "For, wise men possessing equipoised mind,  renouncing the fruit of actions and freed from the  shackles of birth, attain the blissful supreme state. (51)",
          "When your mind will have fully crossed the  mire of delusion, you will then grow indifferent  to the enjoyments of this world and the next  that have been heard of as well as to those that  are yet to be heard of. (52)",
          "When your intellect, confused by hearing  conflicting statements, will rest steady and  undistracted (in meditation) on God, you will then  attain Yoga (everlasting union with God). (53)",
          "Arjuna said : Krsna, what are the characteristics  of a God-realized soul, stable of mind and  established in Samadhi (perfect tranquillity of  mind)? How does the man of stable mind speak,  how does he sit, how does he walk? (54)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: Arjuna, when one thoroughly  casts off all cravings of the mind, and is satisfied  in the Self through the joy of the Self, he is then  called stable of mind. (55)",
          "The sage, whose mind remains unperturbed amid  sorrows, whose thirst for pleasures has altogether  disappeared, and who is free from passion, fear  and anger, is called stable of mind. (56)",
          "He who is unattached to everything, and meeting  with good and evil, neither rejoices nor recoils,  his mind is stable. (57)",
          "When, like a tortoise, that draws in its limbs  from all directions, he withdraws all his senses from  the sense-objects, his mind becomes steady. (58)",
          "Sense-objects turn away from him, who does not  enjoy them with his senses; but the taste for them  persists. This relish also disappears in the case of  the man of stable mind when he realizes the Supreme. (59)",
          "Turbulent by nature, the senses (not free from  attachment) even of a wise man, who is practising  self-control, forcibly carry away his mind, Arjuna.(60)",
          "Therefore, having controlled all the senses and  concentrating his mind, he should sit for  meditation, devoting himself heart and soul to Me.  For. he whose senses are under his control, is  known to have a stable mind. (61)",
          "The man dwelling on sense-objects develops attachment for them; from attachment springs up desire,  and from desire (unfulfilled) ensues anger. (62)",
          "From anger arises delusion; from delusion,  confusion of memory; from confusion of memory,  loss of reason; and from loss of reason one goes  to complete ruin. (63)",
          "But the self-controlled Sadhaka, while enjoying  the various sense-objects through his senses,  which are disciplined and free from likes and  dislikes, attains placidity of mind. (64)",
          "With the attainment of such placidity of mind, all  his sorrows come to an end; and the intellect of such  a person of tranquil mind soon withdrawing itself  from all sides, becomes firmly established in God. (65)",
          "He who has not controlled his mind and  senses, can have no determinate intellect, nor  contemplation. Without contemplation, he can  have no peace; and how can there be happiness  for one lacking peace of mind? (66)",
          "As the wind carries away a boat upon the waters,  even so, of the senses moving among sense-objects,  the one to which the mind is attached, takes away  his discrimination. (67)",
          "Therefore, Arjuna, he whose senses are  completely restrained from their objects, is said  to have a stable mind. (68)",
          "That which is night to all beings, in that state  of Divine Knowledge and Supreme Bliss the God-  realized Yogi keeps awake, and that (the ever-  changing, transient worldly happiness) in which  all beings keep awake, is night to the seer. (69)",
          "As the waters of different rivers enter the  ocean, which, though full on all sides, remains  undisturbed; likewise, he in whom all enjoyments  merge themselves without causing disturbance  attains peace; not he who hankers after such  enjoyments. (70)",
          "He who has given up all desires, and moves  free from attachment, egoism and thirst for  enjoyment attains peace. (71)",
          "Arjuna, such is the state of the God-realized  soul; having reached this state, he overcomes  delusion. And established in this state, even at  the last moment, he attains Brahmic Bliss. (72)"

          "Arjuna said : Krsna, if You consider Knowledge  as superior to Action, why then do You urge me  to this dreadful action, Kesava! (1)",
          "You are, as it were, puzzling my mind by these  seemingly conflicting expressions; therefore, tell  me the one definite discipline by which I may  obtain the highest good. (2)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: Arjuna, in this world two  courses of Sadhana (spiritual discipline) have been  enunciated by Me in the past. In the case of the  Sankhyayogi, the Sadhana proceeds along the path  of Knowledge; whereas in the case of the Karma-  yogr, it proceeds along the path of Action. (3)",
          "Man does not attain freedom from action  (culmination of the discipline of Action) without  entering upon action; nor does he reach perfection  (culmination of the discipline of Knowledge)  merely by ceasing to act. (4)",
          "Surely, none can ever remain inactive even for  a moment; for, everyone is helplessly driven to  action by modes of Prakrti (nature born qualities). (5)",
          "He who outwardly restraining the organs of  sense and action, sits mentally dwelling on the  objects of senses, that man of deluded intellect is  called a hypocrite. (6)",
          "On the other hand, he who controlling the organs  of sense and action by the power of his will, and  remaining unattached, undertakes the Yoga of selfless  Action through those organs, Arjuna, he excels. (7)",
          "Therefore, do you perform your allotted duty;  for action is superior to inaction. Desisting from  action, you cannot even maintain your body. (8)",
          "Man is bound by his own action except when  it is performed for the sake of sacrifice. Therefore,  Arjuna, do you efficiently perform your duty, free  from attachment, for the sake of sacrifice alone. (9)",
          "Having created mankind along with Yajna, at  the beginning of creation, the creator, Brahma, said to  them, “You shall prosper by this; may this yield  the enjoyments you seek. (10)",
          "Foster the gods through this sacrifice, and let  the gods foster you. Thus, each fostering the other  selflessly, you will attain the highest good.(ll)",
          "Fostered by sacrifice, the gods will surely  bestow on you unasked all the desired enjoyments.  He who enjoys the gifts bestowed by them  without offering their share to them, is undoubtedly  a thief. (12)",
          "The virtuous who partake of what is left over  after sacrifice, are absolved of all sins. Those  sinful ones who cook for the sake of nourishing  their bodies alone, partake of sin only. (13)",
          "",
          "All beings are evolved from food; production  of food is dependent on rain; rain ensues from  sacrifice, and sacrifice is rooted in prescribed  action. Know that prescribed action has its  origin in the Vedas, and the Vedas proceed from  the Indestructible (God); hence the all-pervading  Infinite is always present in sacrifice. (14-15)",
          "Arjuna, he who does not follow the wheel of  creation thus set going in this world i.e., does not  perform his duties, leads a sinful and sensual life,  he lives in vain. (16)",
          "He, however, who takes delight in the Self alone  and is gratified with the Self, and is contented in  the Self, has no duty. (17)",
          "In this world that great soul has nothing  to gain by action nor by abstaining from action;  nor has he selfish dependence of any kind on  any creature. (18)",
          "Therefore, go on efficiently doing your duty  at all times without attachment. Doing work  without attachment man attains the Supreme. (19)",
          "It is through action without attachment alone  that lanaka and other wise men reached perfection.  Having in view the maintenance of the world order  too, you should take to action. (20)",
          "For, whatever a great man does, that very thing  other men also do; whatever standard he sets up,  the generality of men follow the same. (21)",
          "Arjuna, there is no duty in all the three worlds  for Me to perform, nor is there anything worth  attaining, unattained by Me; yet I continue to  work. (22)",
          "Should I not engage in action scrupulously at  any time, great harm will come to the world; for,  Arjuna, men follow My way in all matters. (23)",
          "If I ever cease to act, these worlds would perish;  nay, I should prove to be the cause of confusion,  and of the destruction of these people. (24)",
          "Arjuna, as the unwise act with attachment, so  should the wise man, with a view to maintain the  world order, act without attachment. (25)",
          "A wise man established in the Self should not  unsettle the mind of the ignorant attached to action,  but should get them to perform all their duties,  duly performing his own duties. (26)",
          "In fact all actions are being performed by the  modes of Prakrti (Primordial Nature). The fool,  whose mind is deluded by egoism, thinks: “I am  the doer.” (27)",
          "However, he who has true insight into the  respective spheres of Gunas (modes of Prakrti) and  their actions, holding that it is the Gunas (in the  form of the senses, mind, etc.,) that move among  the Gunas (objects of perception), does not get  attached to them, Arjuna. (28)",
          "Those who are completely deluded by the Gunas  (modes) of Prakrti remain attached to those Gunas  and actions; the man of perfect Knowledge should  not unsettle the mind of those ignorants of  imperfect knowledge. (29)",
          "Therefore, dedicating all actions to Me with  your mind fixed on Me, the Self of all, freed from  desire and the feeling of meum and cured of mental  agitation, fight. (30)",
          "Even those men who, with an uncavilling  and devout mind, always follow this teaching  of Mine, are released from the bondage of all  actions. (31)",
          "But they, however, who, finding fault with this  teaching of Mine, do not follow it, take those  fools to be deluded in the matter of all knowledge  as lost. (32)",
          "All living creatures follow their tendencies; even  the wise man acts according to the tendencies of his own  nature. Of what use is restraint by force. (33)",
          "Attraction and repulsion are rooted in all sense-  objects. Man should never allow himself to be  swayed by them, because they are the two principal  enemies standing in the way of his redemption. (34)",
          "One’s own duty, though devoid of merit, is preferable  to the duty of another well performed. Even death  in the performance of one’s own duty brings  blessedness; another’s duty is fraught with fear. (35)",
          "Arjuna said : Now impelled by what, Krsna,  does this man commit sin even involuntarily, as  though driven by force? (36)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : It is desire begotten of the  element of Rajas, which appears as wrath; nay, it  is insatiable and grossly wicked. Know this to be  the enemy in this case. (37)",
          "As fire is covered by smoke, mirror by dust,  and embryo by the amnion, so is knowledge  covered by desire. (38)",
          "And, Arjuna, Knowledge stands covered by this  eternal enemy of the wise, known as desire, which  is insatiable like fire. (39)",
          "The senses, the mind and the intellect are declared  to be its seat; covering the knowledge through  these, it (desire) deludes the embodied soul. (40)",
          "Therefore, Arjuna, you must first control your  senses, and then kill this evil thing which obstructs  Jnana (Knowledge of the Absolute or Nirguna  Brahma) and Vijnana (Knowledge of Sahara  Brahma or manifest Divinity). (41)",
          "The senses are said to be greater than the  body; but greater than the senses is the mind.  Greater than the mind is the intellect; and what  is greater than the intellect is He, the Self. (42)",
          "Thus, Arjuna, knowing the Self which is higher  than the intellect and subduing the mind by reason,  kill this enemy in the form of desire that is hard  to overcome. (43)"

          "Thus transmitted in succession from father to  son, Arjuna, this Yoga remained known to the  Rajarsis (royal sages). Through long lapse of  time, this Yoga got lost to the world. (2)",
          "The same ancient Yoga, which is the supreme  secret, has this day been imparted to you by Me,  because you are My devotee and friend. (3)",
          "Arjuna said: You are of recent origin, while the birth of Vivasvan dates back to remote antiquity.  How, then, am I to believe that You imparted this  Yoga at the beginning of the creation? (4)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: Arjuna, you and I have  passed through many births; I remember them all;  you do not remember, O chastiser of foes. (5)",
          "Though birthless and immortal and the Lord  of all beings, I manifest Myself through My own  Yogamaya (divine potency), keeping My nature  (Prakrti) under control. (6)",
          "Arjuna, whenever righteousness is on the  decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then  I body Myself forth. (7)",
          "For the protection of the virtuous, for the  extirpation of evil-doers, and for establishing  Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I manifest  Myself from age to age. (8)",
          "Arjuna, My birth and activities are divine. He  who knows this in reality is not reborn on leaving  his body, but comes to Me. (9)",
          "Completely rid of attachment, fear and anger,  wholly absorbed in Me, depending on Me, and  purified by the penance of wisdom, many have  become one with Me even in the past. (10)",
          "Arjuna, howsoever men seek Me, even so do  I respond to them; for all men follow My path in  everyway. (11)",
          "In this world of human beings, men seeking  the fruition of their activities, worship the gods;  for success born of actions follows quickly. (12)",
          "The four orders of society (viz., the Brahmana,  the Ksatriya, the Vaisya and the Sudra) were  created by Me, classifying them according to the  Gunas predominant in each and apportioning  corresponding duties to them; though the originator  of this creation, know Me, the Immortal Lord, to  be a non-doer. (13)",
          "Since I have no craving for the fruit of actions,  actions do not taint Me. Even he who thus knows  Me in reality is not bound by actions. (14)",
          "Having known thus, action was performed even  by the ancient seekers for liberation; therefore,  do you also perform actions as have been performed  by the ancients from antiquity. (15)",
          "What is action and what is inaction? Even men  of intelligence are puzzled over this question.  Therefore, I shall expound to you the truth about  action, knowing which you will be freed from its  evil effects i.e., the shackles of karma. (16)",
          "The truth about action must be known and the  truth of inaction also must be known; even so,  the truth about prohibited action (Vikarma) must be  known. For, mysterious are the ways of action. (17)",
          "He who sees inaction in action, and action in  inaction, is wise among men; he is a Yogi, who  has performed all actions. (18)",
          "Even the wise call him a sage, whose  undertakings are all free from desire and Sankalpa  (thoughts of the world) and whose actions are burnt  up by the fire of wisdom. (19)",
          "He, who, having totally given up attachment  to actions and their fruit, no longer depends on  anything in the world, and is ever content, does  nothing at all, though fully engaged in action. (20)",
          "Having subdued his mind and body, and having  given up all objects of enjoyment, free from  craving, he who performs sheer bodily action,  does not incur sin. (21)",
          "The KarmayogI, who is contented with  whatever is got unsought, is free from jealousy  and has transcended all pairs of opposites like  joy and grief, and is balanced in success and  failure, is not bound by his action. (22)",
          "All his actions get dissolved entirely, who is  free from attachment and has no identification  with the body and free from the feeling of mine,  whose mind is established in the knowledge of Self  and who works merely for the sake of sacrifice. (23)",
          "In the practice of seeing Brahma everywhere as  a form of sacrifice, Brahma is the ladle (with which  oblation is poured into the fire, etc.); Brahma, again,  is the oblation; Brahma is the fire, Brahma itself is  the sacrificer and so Brahma itself constitutes the  act of pouring the oblation into the fire. And, finally,  Brahma is the goal to be reached by him who is  absorbed in Brahma as the act of such sacrifice. (24)",
          "Other Yogis duly offer sacrifice only in the  form of worship to gods, while others perform  sacrifice by offering the self by the Self itself in  the fire of Brahma. (25)",
          "Others offer as sacrifice their senses of hearing  etc., into the fires of self-discipline. Other Yogis,  again, offer sound and other objects of perception  into the fires of the senses. (26)",
          "Others sacrifice all the functions of their senses  and the functions of the vital airs (Prana) into the  fire of Yoga in the shape of self-control, kindled  by wisdom. (27)",
          "Some perform sacrifice with material possessions;  some offer sacrifice in the shape of austerities;  others sacrifice through the practice of Yoga; while  some striving souls, observing austere vows,  perform sacrifice in the shape of wisdom through  the study of sacred texts. (28)",
          "Other Yogis offer the act of exhalation into  that of inhalation; even so, others the act of  inhalation into that of exhalation. (29)",
          "There are still  others given to the practice of Pranayama (breath-  control), who, having regulated their diet and  controlled the processes of exhalation and  inhalation both, pour their vital airs into the vital  airs themselves. All these have their sins consumed  away by sacrifice and understand the meaning of  sacrificial worship. (29-30)",
          "Arjuna, Yogis who enjoy the nectar that has  been left over after the performance of a sacrifice  attain the eternal Brahma. To the man who does  not offer sacrifice, even this world is not happy;  how, then, can the other world be happy? (31)",
          "Many such forms of sacrifice have been set  forth in detail in the Vedas; know them all as  involving the action of mind, senses and body.  Thus, knowing the truth about them you shall be  freed from the bondage of action (through their  performance). (32)",
          "Arjuna, sacrifice through Knowledge, is superior  to sacrifice performed with material things. For  all actions without exception culminate in   Knowledge, O son of Kuntl. (33)",
          "Understand tlie true nature of that Knowledge  by approaching seers of Truth. If you prostrate at  their feet, render them service, and question them  with an open and guileless heart, those wise seers  of Truth will instruct you in that Knowledge.(34)",
          "Arjuna, when you have achieved enlightenment,  ignorance will delude you no more. In the light  of that knowledge, you will see the entire creation  first within your own Self, and then in Me (the Oversoul). (35)",
          "Even if you were the most sinful of all sinners,  this Knowledge alone would carry you. like a raft,  across all your sins. (36)",
          "For, as the blazing fire reduces the fuel to ashes,  Arjuna, even so the fire of Knowledge turns all  actions to ashes. (37)",
          "In this world there is no purifier as great as  Knowledge; he who has attained purity of heart   through prolonged practice of Karmayoga,   automatically sees the light of Truth in the self  in course of time. (38)",
          "He who has mastered his senses, is exclusively  devoted to his practice and is full of faith, attains  Knowledge; having had the revelation of Truth,  he immediately attains supreme peace in the form  of God-realization. (39)",
          "He who lacks discrimination, is devoid of faith,  and is at the same time possessed by doubt, is  lost to the spiritual path. For the doubting soul  there is neither this world nor the world beyond,  nor even happiness. (40)",
          "Arjuna, actions do not bind him who has  dedicated all his actions to God according to the  spirit of Karmayoga, whose doubts have been  dispelled by wisdom and who is self-possessed. (41)",
          "Therefore, Arjuna slashing to pieces, with the  sword of knowledge, this doubt in your heart, born  of ignorance, establish yourself in Karmayoga in  the shape of even-mindedness, and stand up for  the fight. (42)"

          "Arjuna said : Krsna, you extol Sankhyayoga (the  Yoga of Knowledge) and then the Yoga of Action.  Pray, tell me which of the two is decidedly  conducive to my good. (1)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : The Yoga of Knowledge  and the Yoga of Action both lead to supreme Bliss.  Of the two, however, the Yoga of Action, being  easier of practice, is superior to the Yoga of  Knowledge. (2)",
          "The KarmayogI who neither hates nor desires  should ever be considered as an ever renunciant.  For. Arjuna, he who is free from the pairs of opposites  is easily liberated from bondage. (3)",
          "It is the ignorant, not the wise, who say that  Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga lead to divergent  results. For, one who is firmly established in either,  gets the fruit of both which is the same, viz., God-  realization. (4)",
          "The (supreme) state which is reached by the  Sankhyayogi is attained also by the Karmayogi.  Therefore, he alone who sees Sankhyayoga and  Karmayoga as identical so far as their result goes,  sees truly. (5)",
          "Without Karmayoga, however, Sankhyayoga  i.e., renunciation of doership in relation to all  activities of the mind, senses and body is difficult  to accomplish; whereas the Karmayogi, who keeps  his mind fixed on God, reaches Brahma in no  time, Arjuna. (6)",
          "The Karmayogi, who has fully conquered his  mind and mastered his senses, whose heart is pure,  and who has identified himself with the Self of  all beings (viz., God), remains untainted, even  though performing action. (7)",
          "However, the Sankhyayogl, who knows the  reality of things, must believe that he does  nothing, even though seeing, hearing, touching,  smelling, eating or drinking, walking, sleeping,  breathing(8)",
          "speaking, answering the calls of nature,  grasping, and opening or closing the eyes, holding  that it is the senses alone that are moving among  their objects. (9)",
          "He who acts offering all actions to God, and  shaking off attachment, remains untouched by sin,  as the lotus leaf by water. (10)",
          "The Karmayogis perform action only with  their senses, mind, intellect and body as well,  without the feeling of mine in respect of them  and shaking off attachment, simply for the sake  of self-purification. (11)",
          "Offering the fruit of actions to God, the  Karmayogt attains everlasting peace in the form  of God-realization; whereas, he who works with  a selfish motive, being attached to the fruit of  actions through desire, gets tied down. (12)",
          "The self-controlled Sankhyayogi, doing nothing  himself and getting nothing done by others, rests  happily in God—the embodiment of Truth,  Knowledge and Bliss, mentally relegating all  actions to the mansion of nine gates (the body  with nine openings). (13)",
          "God determines neither the doership nor the doings  of men, nor even their contact with the fruit of  actions; but it is Nature alone that does all this. (14)",
          "The omnipresent God does not partake the  virtue or sin of anyone. Knowledge is enveloped  by ignorance; hence it is that beings are  constantly falling a prey to delusion. (15)",
          "In the case, however, of those whose said  ignorance has been destroyed by true knowledge  of God, that wisdom shining like the sun reveals  the Supreme. (16)",
          "Those whose mind and intellect are wholly  merged in Him, who remain constantly established in  identity with Him, and have finally become one with  Him, their sins being wiped out by wisdom, reach  the supreme goal whence there is no return. (17)",
          "The wise look with equanimity on all whether it  be a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility,  a cow, an elephant, a dog and a pariah, too. (18)",
          "Even here is the mortal plane conquered by those  whose mind is established in equanimity; since the  Absolute is untouched by evil and is the same to  all, hence they are established in Paramatma. (19)",
          "He who, with firm intellect and free from doubt,  rejoices not on obtaining what is pleasant and  does not feel perturbed on meeting with the  unpleasant, that knower of Brahma lives eternally  in identity with Brahma. (20)",
          "He whose mind remains unattached to sense-  objects, derives through meditation, the Sattvika  joy which dwells in the mind; then that Yogi,  having completely identified himself through  meditation with Brahma, enjoys eternal Bliss. (21)",
          "The pleasures which are born of sense-contacts,  are verily a source of suffering only (though  appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people).  They have a beginning and an end (they come  and go); Arjuna, it is for this reason that a wise  man does not indulge in them. (22)",
          "He alone, who is able to withstand, in this very  life before casting off this body, the urges of lust  and anger, is a Yogi, and he alone is a happy man. (23)",
          "He who is happy within himself, enjoys within  himself the delight of the soul, and, even so, is  illumined by the inner light (light of the soul),  such a Yogi (Sankhyayogi) identified with Brahma  attains Brahma, who is all peace. (24)",
          "The seers whose sins have been purged, whose  doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, whose  disciplined mind is firmly established in God and  who are devoted to the welfare of all beings, attain  Brahma, who is all peace. (25)",
          "To those wise men who are free from lust and  anger, who have subdued their mind and have  realized God, Brahma, the abode of eternal peace,  is present all-round. (26)",
          "Shutting out all thoughts of external  enjoyments, with the gaze fixed on the space  between the eye-brows, having regulated the  Prana (outgoing) and the Apana (incoming)  breaths flowing within the nostrils(27)",
          "he who has  brought his senses, mind and intellect under  control—such a contemplative soul intent on  liberation and free from desire, fear and anger,  is ever liberated. (28)",
          "Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer of  all sacrifices and austerities, the supreme Lord of  all the worlds, and the selfless friend of all beings,  My devotee attains peace. (29)"

          "Sri Bhagavan said: He who does his duty  without expecting the fruit of actions is a Sannyasi  (Sankhyayogi) and a Yogi (Karmayogi) both. He  is no Sannyasi (renouncer) who has merely  renounced the sacred fire; even so, he is no Yogi  who has merely given up all activity. (1)",
          "Arjuna, you must know that what they call  Sannyasa is no other than Yoga; for none becomes  a Yogi, who has not abandoned his ‘Sankalpas’  (thoughts of the world). (2)",
          "To the contemplative soul who desires to attain  Karmayoga, selfless action is said to be the means;  for the same man when he is established in Yoga,  absence of all ‘Sankalpas’ (thoughts of the world)  is said to be the way to blessedness. (3)",
          "When a man ceases to have any attachment  for the objects of senses and for actions, and has  renounced all ‘Sankalpas’ (thoughts of the world),  he is said to have attained Yoga. (4)",
          "One should lift oneself by one’s own efforts  and should not degrade oneself; for one’s own  self is one’s friend, and one’s own self is one’s  enemy. (5)",
          "One’s own Self is the friend of the soul by whom  the lower self (consisting of the mind, senses and  body) has been conquered; even so, the very Self  of him, who has not conquered his lower self,  behaves antagonistically like an enemy. (6)",
          "The Supreme Spirit is rooted in the knowledge  of the self-controlled man whose mind is perfectly  serene in the midst of pairs of opposites, such as  cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and honour and  ignominy. (7)",
          "The Yogi whose mind is sated with Jnana  (Knowledge of Nirguna Brahma) and Vijnana  (Knowledge of manifest Divinity), who is unmoved  under any circumstances, whose senses are  completely under control, and to whom earth, stone  and gold are all alike, is spoken of as a God-  realized soul. (8)",
          "He who looks upon well-wishers and neutrals  as well as mediators, friends and foes, relatives  and inimicals, the virtuous and the sinful with  equanimity, stands supreme. (9)",
          "Living in seclusion all by himself, the Yogi  who has controlled his mind and body, and is  free from desires and void of possessions, should  constantly engage his mind in meditation. (10)",
          "Having firmly set his seat in a spot which is  free from dirt and other impurities with the sacred  Kusa grass, a deerskin and a cloth spread thereon,  one upon the other, (Kusa below, deerskin in the middle and cloth uppermost), neither very high  nor very low; (11)",
          "And, occupying that seat, concentrating the  mind and controlling the functions of the mind  and senses, he should practise Yoga for self¬  purification. (12)",
          "Holding the hunk, head and neck straight and  steady, remaining firm and fixing the gaze on the tip  of his nose, without looking in other directions. (13)",
          "Firm in the vow of complete chastity and  fearless, keeping himself perfectly calm and with  the mind held in restraint and fixed on Me, the  vigilant Yogi should sit absorbed in Me. (14)",
          "Thus, constantly applying his mind to Me, the Yogi  of disciplined mind, attains everlasting peace,  consisting of Supreme Bliss, which abides in Me. (15)",
          "Arjuna, this Yoga is neither for him who  overeats, nor for him who observes complete  fast; it is neither for him who is given to too  much sleep, nor even for him who is ceaselessly  awake. (16)",
          "Yoga, which rids one of woe, is accomplished  only by him who is regulated in diet and  recreation, regulated in performing actions, and  regulated in sleep and wakefulness. (17)",
          "When the mind which is thoroughly disciplined,  gets riveted on God alone, then the person who  is free from yearning for all enjoyments is said to  be established in Yoga. (18)",
          "As a flame does not flicker in a windless  place, such is stated to be the picture of the  disciplined mind of the Yogi practising meditation  on God. (19)",
          "The state in which the Citta (mind-stuff)  subdued through the practice of Yoga, becomes completely tranquil, and in which realizing God  through subtle reasoning purified by meditation  on God, the soul rejoices only in God; (20)",
          "Nay, in which the soul experiences the eternal  and super-sensuous joy which can be intuited only  through the subtle and purified intellect, and  wherein established the said Yogi moves not from  Truth on any account; (21)",
          "And having obtained which he does not reckon  any other gain as greater than that, and established  in which he is not shaken even by the heaviest of  sorrows; (22)",
          "That state, called Yoga, which is free from the  contact of sorrow (in the form of transmigration),  should be known. Nay, this Yoga should be resolutely  practised with an unwearied mind. (23)",
          "Completely renouncing all desires arising from  Sankalpas (thoughts of the world), and fully restraining  all the senses from all sides by the mind; (24)",
          "He should through gradual practice, attain  tranquillity; and fixing the mind on God through  reason controlled by steadfastness, he should not  think of anything else. (25)",
          "Drawing back the restless and fidgety mind  from all those objects after which it runs, he should  repeatedly fix it on God. (26)",
          "For, to the Yogi whose mind is perfectly serene,  who is sinless, whose passion is subdued, and who  is identified with Brahma, the embodiment of  Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, supreme happiness  comes as a matter of course. (27)",
          "The sinless Yogi, thus uniting his Self constantly  with God, easily enjoys the eternal Bliss of oneness  with Brahma. (28)",
          "The Yogi who is united in identity with the all-  pervading, infinite consciousness, whose vision     everywhere is even, beholds the Self existing in  all beings and all beings as assumed in the Self. (29)",
          "He who sees Me (the Universal Self) present in all  beings, and all beings existing within Me, he is never  out of My sight, nor am I ever out of his sight. (30)",
          "The Yogi who is established in union with Me, and  worships Me as residing in all beings as their very Self,  whatever activities he performs, he performs them in Me. (31)",
          "Arjuna, he, who looks on all as one, on the  analogy of his own Self, and looks upon the joy  and sorrow of all equally-such a Yogi is deemed  to be the highest of all. (32)",
          "Arjuna said : Krsna, owing to restlessness of mind  I do not perceive the stability of this Yoga in the form  of equanimity, which You have just spoken of. (33)",
          "For, Krsna. the mind is very unsteady, turbulent,  tenacious and powerful; therefore, I consider it as  difficult to control as the wind. (34)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : The mind is restless no  doubt, and difficult to curb, Arjuna; but it can be  brought under control by repeated practice (of  meditation) and by the exercise of dispassion, O  son of Kuntl. (35)",
          "Yoga is difficult of achievement by one whose  mind is not subdued by him; however, who has  the mind under control, and is ceaselessly striving,  it can be easily attained through practice. Such  is My conviction. (36)",
          "Arjuna said : Krsna, what becomes of the aspirant  who, though endowed with faith, has not been  able to subdue his passions, and whose mind is,  therefore, diverted from Yoga at the time of  death, and who thus fails to reach perfection in  Yoga (God-realization)? (37)",
          "Krsna, swerved from the path leading to  God-realization and without anything to stand  upon, is he not lost like the scattered cloud,  deprived of both God-realization and heavenly  enjoyment? (38)",
          "Krsna, only You are capable to remove this  doubt of mine completely; for none other than  You can dispel this doubt. (39)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : Arjuna, there is no fall for  him either here or hereafter. For, O My beloved,  none who strives for self-redemption (i.e.. God-  realization) ever meets with evil destiny. (40)",
          "Such a person who has strayed from Yoga,  obtains the higher worlds, (heaven etc.) to which  men of meritorious deeds alone are entitled, and  having resided there for innumerable years, takes  birth of pious and prosperous parents. (41)",
          "Or, if he is possessed of dispassion, then not  attaining to those regions he is born in the family  of enlightened Yogis; but such a birth in this world  is very difficult to obtain. (42)",
          "Arjuna, he automatically regains in that birth  the latencies of even-mindedness of his previous  birth; and through that he strives harder than ever  for perfection in the form of God-realization. (43)",
          "The other one who takes birth in a rich family,  though under the sway of his senses, feels drawn  towards God by force of the habit acquired in his  previous birth; nay, even the seeker of Yoga (in  the form of even-mindedness) transcends the fruit  of actions performed with some interested motive  as laid down in the Vedas. (44)",
          "The Yogi, however, who diligently takes up  the practice, attains perfection in this very life  with the help of latencies of many births, and  being thoroughly purged of sin, forthwith reaches  the supreme state. (45)",
          "The Yogi is superior to the ascetics; he is  regarded superior even to those versed in sacred  lore. The Yogi is also superior to those who perform  action with some interested motive. Therefore,  Arjuna, do become a Yogi. (46)",
          "Of all Yogis, again, he who devoutly worships  Me with his mind focussed on Me is considered  by Me to be the best Yogi. (47)"

(1)",
          "I shall unfold to you in its entirety this wisdom  (Knowledge of God in His absolute formless aspect)  along with the Knowledge of the qualified aspect  of God (both with form and without form), having  known which nothing else remains yet to be known  in this world. (2)",
          "Hardly one among thousands of men strives to  realize Me; of those striving Yogis, again, some  rare one, devoting himself exclusively to Me,  knows Me in reality. (3)",

          "This indeed is My lower (material)  nature; the other than this, by which the whole  universe is sustained, know it to be My higher  (or spiritual) nature in the form of Jiva (the life-  principle), O Arjuna. (5)",
          "Arjuna, know that all beings have evolved  from this twofold Prakrti, and that I am the  source of the entire creation, and into Me again  it dissolves. (6)",
          "There is nothing else besides Me, Arjuna. Like  clusters of yarn-beads formed by knots on a thread,  all this is threaded on Me. (7)",

          "The fruit gained by these people of small  understanding, however, is perishable. The  worshippers of gods attain the gods; whereas My  devotees, howsoever they worship Me, eventually  come to Me and Me alone. (23)",

(11)",

          "Arjuna, I shall now tell you the time (path)  departing when Yogis do not return, and also the  time (path) departing when they do return. (23)",
          "(Of the two paths) the one is that in which are  stationed the all-effulgent fire-god and the deities  presiding over daylight, the bright fortnight, and  the six months of the northward course of the sun  respectively; proceeding along it after death Yogis,  who have known Brahma, being successively led  by the above gods, finally reach Brahma. (24)",
          "The other path is that wherein are stationed  the gods presiding over smoke, night, the dark  fortnight, and the six months of the southward  course of the sun; the Yogi (devoted to action  with an interested motive) taking to this path after  death is led by the above gods, one after another,  and attaining the lustre of the moon (and enjoying  the fruit of his meritorious deeds in heaven) returns  to this mortal world. (25)",
          "For these two paths of the world, the bright  and the dark, are considered to be eternal.  Proceeding by one of them, one reaches the  supreme state from which there is no return; and  proceeding by the other, one returns to the mortal  world, i.e., becomes subject to birth and death  once more. (26)",
          "Knowing thus the secret of these two paths, O  son of KuntI, no Yogi gets deluded. Therefore,  Arjuna, at all times be steadfast in Yoga in the  form of equanimity (i.e., strive constantly for My  realization). (27)",
          "The Yogi, realizing this profound truth,  doubtless transcends all the rewards enumerated  for the study of the Vedas as well as for the  performance of sacrifices, austerities and charities,  and attains the supreme and primal state. (28)"

          "Sri Bhagavan said : To you, who are devoid  of the carping spirit, I shall now unfold the most  secret knowledge of Nirguna Brahma along  with the knowledge of manifest Divinity,  knowing which you shall be free from the evil  of worldly existence. (1)",
          "This knowledge (of both the Nirguna and  Saguna aspects of Divinity) is a sovereign science,  a sovereign secret, supremely holy, most excellent,  directly enjoyable, attended with virtue, very easy  to practise and imperishable. (2)",
          "Arjuna, people having no faith in this Dharma,  failing to reach Me, continue to revolve in the  path of the world of birth and death. (3)",
          "The whole of this universe is permeated by  Me as unmanifest Divinity, like ice by water and  all beings dwell on the idea within Me. But, really  speaking, I am not present in them. (4)",
          "Nay. all those beings abide not in Me; but  behold the wonderful power of My divine Yoga;  though the Sustainer and Creator of beings. Myself  in reality dwell not in those beings. (5)",
          "Just as the extensive air, which is moving  everywhere, (being born of ether) ever remains in  ether, likewise, know that all beings, who have  originated from My Sankalpa, abide in Me. (6)",
          "Arjuna, during the Final Dissolution all  beings enter My Prakrti (the prime cause), and  at the beginning of creation, I send them forth  again. (7)",
          "Wielding My Nature I procreate again and  again, according to their respective Karmas, all  this multitude of beings subject to the sway of  their own nature. (8)",
          "Arjuna, those actions, however, do not bind   Me, unattached as I am to such actions, and  standing apart as it were. (9)",
          "Arjuna, under My aegis. Nature brings forth  the whole creation, consisting of both sentient  and insentient beings; it is due to this cause that  the wheel of Samsara is going round. (10)",
          "Not Knowing My supreme nature, fools deride  Me, the Overlord of the entire creation, who have  assumed the human form. That is to say, they take  Me, who have appeared in human form through  My ‘Yogamaya’ for deliverance of the world, as  an ordinary mortal. (11)",
          "Those bewildered persons with vain hopes,  futile actions and fruitless knowledge, have  embraced a fiendish, demoniacal and delusive  nature. (12)",
          "On the other hand, Arjuna, great souls who   have adopted the divine nature, knowing Me as  the prime source of all beings and the imperishable  eternal, worship Me constantly with one-   pointedness of mind. (13)",
          "Constantly chanting My names and glories and  striving for My realization, and bowing again and  again to Me, those devotees of firm resolve, ever  united with me through meditation, worship Me  with single-minded devotion. (14)",
          "Others, who follow the path of Knowledge,  betake themselves to Me through Yajna of  Knowledge, worshipping Me in My absolute,  formless aspect as one with themselves; while still  others worship Me in My Universal Form in many  ways, taking Me to be diverse in manifold celestial  forms. (15)",
          "I am the Vedic ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am  the offering to the departed; I am the herbage and  foodgrains; I am the sacred mantra, I am the clarified  butter. I am the sacred fire, and I am verily the act  of offering oblations into the fire. (16)",
          "I am the sustainer and ruler of this universe, its  father, mother and grandfather, the one worth  knowing, the purifier, the sacred syllable OM, and  the three Vedas—Rk, Yajus and Sama. (17)",
          "I am the supreme goal, sustainer, lord, witness,  abode, refuge, well-wisher seeking no return, origin  and end, resting-place, store-house to which all  beings return at the time of universal destruction,  and the imperishable seed. (18)",
          "I radiate heat as the sun, and hold back  as well as send forth showers, Arjuna. I am  immortality as well as death; even so, I am being  and also non-being. (19)",
          "Those who perform action with some interested  motive as laid down in these three Vedas and  drink the sap of the Soma plant, and have thus been  purged of sin, worshipping Me through sacrifices,  seek access to heaven; attaining Indra’s paradise  as the result of their virtuous deeds, they enjoy  the celestial pleasures of gods in heaven. (20)",
          "Having enjoyed the extensive heaven-world,  they return to this world of mortals on the stock  of their merits being exhausted. Thus devoted to  the ritual with interested motive, recommended  by the three Vedas as the means of attaining  heavenly bliss, and seeking worldly enjoyments,  they repeatedly come and go (i.e., ascend to heaven  by virtue of their merits and return to earth when  their fruit has been enjoyed). (21)",
          "The devotees, however, who loving no one else  constantly think of Me, and worship Me in a  disinterested spirit, to those ever united in thought  with Me, I bring full security and personally attend  to their needs. (22)",
          "Arjuna, even those devotees who, endowed with  faith, worship other gods (with some interested  motive) worship Me alone, though with a mistaken  approach. (23)",
          "For, I am the enjoyer and also the lord of all  sacrifices; but they who do not know Me in reality  as the Supreme Deity, they fall i.e., return to life  on earth. (24)",
          "Those who are votaries of gods, go to gods,  those who are votaries of manes, reach the manes;  those who adore the spirits, reach the spirits and  those who worship Me, come to Me alone. That  is why My devotees are no longer subject to birth  and death. (25)",
          "Whosoever offers Me with love a leaf, a  flower, a fruit or water, I, appear in person before  that selfless devotee of sinless mind, and  delightfully partake of that article offered by him  with love. (26)",
          "Arjuna, whatever you do, whatever you eat,  whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire,  whatever you bestow as a gift, whatever you do  by way of penance, offer all that to Me. (27)",
          "With your mind thus established in the Yoga  of renunciation (offering of all actions to Me),  you will be freed from the bondage of action in  the form of good and evil results; thus freed from  them, you will attain Me. (28)",
          "I am equally present in all beings; there is none  hateful or dear to Me. They, however, who devoutly  worship Me abide in Me; and I too stand revealed  to them. (29)",
          "Even if the vilest sinner worships Me with  exclusive devotion, he should be regarded a saint;  for, he has rightly resolved. (He is positive in his  belief that there is nothing like devoted worship  of God). (30)",
          "Speedily he becomes virtuous and attains  abiding peace. Know it for certain, Arjuna, that  My devotee never perishes. (31)",
          "Arjuna, women, Vaisyas (members of the trading  and agriculturist classes), Sudras (those belonging to  the labour and artisan classes), as well as those of  impious birth (such as the pariah), whoever they may be,  taking refuge in Me, they too attain the supreme goal. (32)",
          "How much more, then, if they be holy  Brahmanas and royal sages devoted to Me!  Therefore, having obtained this joyless and  transient human life, constantly worship Me. (33)",
          "Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me,  worship Me and make obeisance to Me; thus  linking yourself with Me and entirely depending  on Me, you shall come to Me. (34)"

Of  feminities, I am KIrti, Sri,Vak, Smrti, Medha, Dhrti  and Ksama (the goddesses presiding over glory,  prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence, fortitude  and forbearance, respectively). (34)",
          "Likewise, among the Srutis that can be sung, I am  the variety known as Brhatsama; while among  the Vedic hymns, I am the hymn known as Gayatrl.  Again, among the twelve months of the Hindu  calendar, I am the month known as ‘Margasrrsa’ (corres¬  ponding approximately to November-December);  and among the six seasons (successively appearing in  India in the course of a year), I am the spring season.(35)",
          "I am gambling among deceitful practices, and  the glory of the glorious. I am the victory of the  victorious, the resolve of the resolute, the goodness  of the good. (36)",
          "I am Krsna among the Vrsnis, Arjuna among  the sons of Pandu, Vyasa among the sages, and  the sage Sukracarya among the wise. (37)",
          "I am the subduing power of rulers; I am  righteousness in those who seek to conquer. Of things  to be kept secret, I am the custodian in the form of  reticence; and I am the wisdom of the wise. (38)",
          "Arjuna, I am even that, which is the seed of all  life. For there is no creature, moving or unmoving,  which can exist without Me. (39)",
          "Arjuna, there is no limit to My divine  manifestations. This is only a brief description  by Me of the extent of My glory. (40)",
          "Every such being as is glorious, brilliant and  powerful, know that to be a part manifestation of  My glory. (41)",
          "Or, what will you gain by knowing all this  in detail, Arjuna? Suffice it to say that I hold  this entire universe by a fraction of My Yogic  Power. (42)"

          "Arjuna said : Thanks to the most profound words  of spiritual wisdom that You have spoken out of  kindness to me, this delusion of mine has entirely  disappeared. (1)",
          "For, Krsna, I have heard from You in detail an  account of the evolution and dissolution of beings,  and also Your immortal glory. (2)",
          "Lord, You are precisely what You declare Yourself  to be. But I long to see Your divine form possessed  of wisdom, glory, energy, strength, valour and  effulgence, O Purusottama, the Supreme Being! (3)",
          "Krsna, if You think that it can be seen by me,     then, O Lord of Yoga, reveal to me Your  imperishable form. (4)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: Arjuna, behold My manifold,  multifarious divine forms of various colours and  shapes, in their hundreds and thousands. (5)",
          "Behold in Me, Arjuna, the twelve sons of Aditi,  the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras (gods of  destruction), the two Asvinikumaras (the twin-born  physicians of gods) and the forty-nine Maruts  (wind-gods), and witness many more wonderful   forms never seen before. (6)",
          "Arjuna, behold as concentrated within this body  of Mine the entire creation consisting of both the  moving and the unmoving beings, and whatever  else you desire to see. (7)",
          "But surely you cannot see Me with these physical  eyes of yours; therefore, I vouchsafe to you the     divine eye. With this you behold My divine power  of Yoga. (8)",
          "Sanjaya said : My lord! having spoken thus,  Sri Krsna, the supreme Master of Yoga, forthwith  revealed to Arjuna His supremely glorious divine  Form. (9)",
          "Arjuna saw the supreme Deity possessing many  mouths and eyes, presenting many a wonderful  sight, decked with many divine ornaments,  wielding many uplifted divine weapons.(10)",
          "Wearing  divine garlands and vestments, anointed all over  with divine fragrances, full of all wonders, infinite  and having faces on all sides. (11)",
          "If there be the effulgence of a thousand suns  bursting forth all at once in the heavens, even  that would hardly approach the splendour of the  mighty Lord. (12)",
          "Concentrated at one place in the person of that  supreme Deity, Arjuna then beheld the whole  universe with its manifold divisions. (13)",
          "Then Arjuna, full of wonder and with the hair  standing on end, reverentially bowed his head to  the divine Lord, and with folded hands addressed  Him thus. (14)",
          "Arjuna said : Lord, I behold within Your body  all gods and hosts of different beings, Brahma  throned on his lotus-seat, Siva and all Rsis and  celestial serpents. (15)",
          "O Lord of the universe, I see You endowed  with numerous arms, bellies, mouths, and eyes  and having innumerable forms extended on all  sides. O Lord, manifested in the form of the  universe, I see neither Your beginning nor middle,  nor even Your end. (16)",
          "I see you endowed with diadem, club and discus,  a mass of splendour glowing all round, having  the brilliance of a blazing fire and the sun, hard  to gaze at and immeasurable on all sides. (17)",
          "You are the supreme indestructible worthy of  being known; you are the ultimate refuge of this  universe. You are, again, the protector of the ageless  Dharma; I consider You to be the eternal  imperishable Being. (18)",
          "I see You without beginning, middle or end,  possessing unlimited prowess and endowed with  numberless arms, having the moon and the sun  for Your eyes, and blazing fire for Your mouth,  and scorching this universe by Your radiance. (19)",
          "Yonder space between heaven and earth and  all the quarters are entirely filled by You alone.  Seeing this transcendent, dreadful Form of Yours,  O Soul of the universe, all the three worlds feel  greatly perturbed. (20)",
          "Yonder hosts of gods are entering You; some  with palms joined out of fear are recounting Your  names and glories. Multitudes of Maharsis and  Siddhas, saying ‘Let there be peace’, are extolling  You by means of excellent hymns. (21)",
          "The eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas and eight  Vasus, the Sadhyas and Visvedevas, the two  Asvinlkumaras and forty-nine Maruts, as well as  the manes and multitudes of Gandharvas, Yaksas,  Asuras and Siddhas. all these gaze upon You in  amazement. (22)",
          "Lord, seeing this stupendous and dreadful Form  of Yours, possessing numerous mouths and eyes,  many arms, thighs and feet, many bellies and many  teeth, the worlds are terror-struck; so am I. (23)",
          "Lord, seeing Your Form reaching the heavens,  effulgent multi-coloured, having its mouth wide  open and possessing large flaming eyes, I, with  my inmost self frightened, have lost self-control  and find no peace. (24)",
          "Seeing Your faces frightful on account of teeth  therein and blazing like the fire at the time of  universal destruction, I am utterly bewildered and  find no happiness; therefore, have mercy on me, O  Lord of celestials! O Abode of the universe! (25)",
          "All those sons of Dhrtarastra with hosts of kings  are entering You. Bhlsma, Drona and yonder Kama,  with the principal warriors on our side as well (26)",
          "are rushing headlong into Your fearful mouths  looking all the more terrible on account of the  teeth; some are seen stuck up in the gaps between  Your teeth with their heads emshed. (27)",
          "As the myriad streams of rivers rush towards  the sea alone, so do those warriors of the mortal  world enter Your flaming mouths. (28)",
          "As moths rush with great speed into the blazing  fire for extinction out of ‘Moha’, even so, all these  people are with great rapidity entering Your mouths  to meet their doom. (29)",
          "Devouring all the worlds through Your flaming  mouths and licking them on all sides, O Lord  Visnu! Your fiery rays fill the whole universe with  their fierce radiance and are scorching it. (30)",
          "Tell me who You are with a form so terrible?  My obeisance to You, O best of gods; be kind to me.  I wish to know You, the Primal Being, in particular;  for I know not what you intend to do. (31)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: I am mighty Kala (the  eternal Time-spirit), the destroyer of the worlds.  I am out to exterminate these people. Even without  you all those warriors, arrayed in the enemy’s camp,  shall die. (32)",
          "Therefore, do you arise and win glory;  conquering foes, enjoy the affluent kingdom. These  warriors stand already slain by Me; be you only  an instrument, Arjuna. (33)",
          "Do kill Drona and Bhisma and Jayadratha and  Kama and other brave warriors, who already stand  killed by Me; fear not. Fight and you will surely  conquer the enemies in the war. (34)",
          "Sanjaya said : Hearing these words of Bhagavan  Kesava, Arjuna tremblingly bowed to Him with  joined palms, and bowing again in extreme terror  spoke to Sri Krsna in faltering accents. (35)",
          "Arjuna said : Lord, well it is, the universe exults  and is filled with love by chanting Your names,  virtues and glory; terrified Raksasas are fleeing  in all directions, and all the hosts of Siddhas are  bowing to You. (36)",
          "O Great soul, why should they not bow to you,  who are the progenitor of Brahma himself and  the greatest of the great? O infinite, O Lord of  celestials, O Abode of the universe. You are that  which is existent (Sat), that which is non-existent  (Asat) and also that which is beyond both, viz.,  the indestructible Brahma. (37)",
          "You are the primal Deity, the most ancient  Person; You are the ultimate resort of this universe.  You are both the knower and the knowable, and  the highest abode. It is You who pervade the  universe, O one assuming endless forms. (38)",
          "You are Vayu (the wind-god), Yama (the god  of death), Agni (the god of fire), Varuna (the god  of water), the moon-god, Brahma (the Lord of  creation), nay, the father of Brahma himself. Hail,  hail to You a thousand times; salutations, repeated  salutations to You once again. (39)",
          "O Lord of infinite prowess, my salutations to  You from the front and from behind. O soul of  all, my obeisance to You from all sides indeed.  You, who possess infinite might, pervade all;  therefore. You are all. (40)",
          "The way in which I have importunately called  You, either through intimacy or thoughtlessly, “Ho  Krsna! Ho Yadava! Ho Comrade!” and so on,  unaware of the greatness of Yours, and thinking  You only to be a friend(41)",
          "And the way in which O  Acyuta! the Infallible! You have been slighted  by me in jest, while at play, reposing, sitting or  at meals, either alone or even in the presence of  others—for all that, O Immeasurable Lord, I crave  forgiveness from You. (42)",
          "You are the Father of this moving and unmoving  creation, nay, the greatest teacher worthy of  adoration. O Lord of incomparable might, in all the  three worlds there is none else even equal to You;  how, then, can anyone be greater than You? (43)",
          "Therefore, Lord, prostrating my body at Your  feet and bowing low I seek to propitiate You, the  ruler of all and worthy of all praise. It behoves  You to bear with me even as a father bears with  his son, a friend with his friend and a husband  with his beloved spouse. (44)",
          "Having seen Your wondrous form, which was  never seen before, I feel transported with joy; at  the same time my mind is tormented by fear. Pray!  reveal to me that divine form, the form of Visnu  with four-arms; O Lord of celestials, O Abode of  the universe, be gracious. (45)",
          "I wish to see You adorned in the same way    with a diadem on the head, and holding a mace  and a discus in two of Your hands. O Lord with  a thousand arms, O Universal Being, appear again  in the same four-armed Form. (46)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : Arjuna! pleased with you  I have shown you, through My power of Yoga,  this supreme, effulgent, primal and infinite Cosmic  Form, which has never been seen before by anyone  other than you. (47)",
          "Arjuna, in this mortal world I cannot be seen  in this Form by anyone other than you, either  through the study of the Vedas or by rituals, or,  again, through gifts, actions or austere penances.(48)",
          "Seeing such a dreadful Form of Mine as this.  do not be perturbed or perplexed; with a fearless  and tranquil mind, behold once again the same  four-armed Form of Mine bearing the conch, discus,  mace and lotus. (49)",
          "Sanjaya said : Having spoken thus to Arjuna,  Bhagavan Vasudeva again revealed to him His  own four-armed Form; and then, assuming a genial  form, the high-souled Sri Krsna consoled the  frightened Arjuna. (50)",
          "Arjuna said : Krsna, seeing this gentle human  form of Yours I have regained my composure and  am my ownself again. (51)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : This form of Mine (with  four-arms) which you have just seen, is exceedingly  difficult to behold. Even the gods are always eager  to see this form. (52)",
          "Neither by study of the Vedas, nor by penance,  nor again by charity, nor even by rituals can I be  seen in this form (with four-arms) as you have  seen Me. (53)",
          "Through single-minded devotion, however, I  can be seen in this form (with four-arms), nay,  known in essence and even entered into, O valiant  Arjuna. (54)",
          "Arjuna, he who performs all his duties for My  sake, depends on Me, is devoted to Me, has no  attachment, and is free from malice towards all  beings, reaches Me. (55)"

Knowledge and Bliss solidified)—  of these two types of worshippers who are the  best knowers of Yoga? (1)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said : I consider them to be the  best Yogis, who endowed with supreme faith, and  ever united through meditation with Me, worship  Me with their mind centred on Me. (2)",

(3-4)",
          "Of course, the strain is greater for those who  have their mind attached to the Unmanifest, as  attunement with the Unmanifest is attained with  difficulty by the body-conscious people. (5)",

          "If you cannot steadily fix the mind on Me,  Arjuna, then seek to attain Me through the Yoga  of practice. (9)",
          "If you are unequal even to the pursuit of  such practice, be intent to work for Me; you shall  attain perfection (in the form of My realization)  even by performing actions for My sake. (10)",

          "Sri Bhagavan said : This body, Arjuna is termed  as the Field (Ksetra) and he who knows it, is called  the knower of the Field (Ksetrajna) by the sages  discerning the truth about both. (1)",
          "Know Myself to be the Ksetrajna (individual  soul) in all the Ksetras (fields), Arjuna. And  it is the knowledge of the field (Ksetra) and  knower (Ksetrajna) (i.e., of Matter with its  evolutes and the Spirit) which I consider as  true knowledge. (2)",
          "What that Field (Ksetra) is and what is its nature,  what are its modifications, and from what causes  what effects have arisen, and also who its knower  (Ksetrajna) is, and what is His glory—hear all this  from Me in brief. (3)",
          "The truth about the Ksetra and the Ksetrajna  has been expounded by the seers in manifold ways;  again, it has been separately stated in different  Vedic chants and also in the conclusive and  reasoned texts of the Brahmasutras. (4)",
          "The five elements, the ego, the intellect, the  Unmanifest (Primordial Matter), the ten organs  of perception and action, the mind, and the  five objects of sense (sound, touch, colour, taste  and smell). (5)",
          "Also desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, the physical  body, consciousness, firmness: thus is the Ksetra,  with its evolutes, briefly stated. (6)",
          "Absence of pride, freedom from hypocrisy, non¬  violence, forbearance, uprightness of speech and  mind etc., devout service of the preceptor, internal     and external purity, steadfastness of mind and  control of body, mind and the senses; (7)",
          "Dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of  this world and the next, and also absence of egotism,  pondering again and again on the pain and evils  inherent in birth, death, old age and disease; (8)",
          "Absence of attachment and the sense of mineness  in respect of son, wife, home etc., and constant  equipoise of mind both in favourable and  unfavourable circumstances; (9)",
          "Unflinching devotion to Me through exclusive  attachment, living in secluded and holy places, and  finding no delight in the company of worldly  people; (10)",
          "Constancy in self-knowledge and seeing God  as the object of true knowledge—all this is declared    as knowledge, and what is contrary to this is called  ignorance. (11)",
          "I shall speak to you at length about that which  ought to be known, and knowing which one attains  supreme Bliss. That supreme Brahma, who is the lord  of the two beginningless entities—Prakrti and JTva is  said to be neither Sat (being) nor Asat (non-being).(12)",
          "It has hands and feet on all sides, eyes, head  and mouth in all directions, and ears all-round;  for it stands pervading all in the universe. (13)",
          "Though perceiving all sense-objects, it is really  speaking devoid of all senses. Nay, though  unattached, it is the sustainer of all nonetheless;  and though attributeless, it is the enjoyer of Gunas,  the three modes of Prakrti. (14)",
          "It exists without and within all beings, and constitutes  the moving and the unmoving creation as well. And    by reason of its subtlety, it is incomprehensible; it  is close at hand and stands afar too. (15)",
          "Though integral like space in its undivided   aspect, it appears divided as it were, in all animate  and inanimate beings. And that Godhead, which  is the only object worth knowing, is the sustainer  of beings (as Visnu), the destroyer (as Rudra) and  the creator of all (as Brahma). (16)",
          "That supreme Brahma is said to be the light of  all lights and entirely beyond Maya. That godhead  is knowledge itself, worth knowing, and worth  attaining through real wisdom, and is particularly  abiding in the hearts of all. (17)",
          "Thus the truth of the Ksetra and knowledge, as   well as of the object worth knowing, i.e., God,  has been briefly discussed; knowing this in reality,  My devotee attains to My being. (18)",
          "Prakrti and Purusa, know both these as  beginningless. And know all modifications such  as likes and dislikes etc., and all objects constituted  of the three Gunas as bom of Prakrti. (19)",
          "Prakrti is said to be responsible for bringing  forth the evolutes and the instruments; while the  individual soul is declared to be responsible for  the experience of joys and sorrows. (20)",
          "Only the Purusa in association with Prakrti  experiences objects of the nature of the three Gunas  evolved from Prakrti and it is attachment with  these Gunas that is responsible for the birth of  this soul in good and evil wombs. (21)",
          "The Spirit dwelling in this body, is really the  same as the Supreme. He has been spoken of as  the Witness, the true Guide, the Sustainer of all,  the Experiencer (as the embodied soul), the Overlord  and the Absolute as well. (22)",
          "He who thus knows the Purusa (Spirit) and  Prakrti (Nature) together with the Gunas—even  though performing his duties in everyway, is not  born again. (23)",
          "Some by meditation behold the supreme Spirit  in the heart with the help of their refined and  sharp intellect; others realize it through the  discipline of Knowledge, and still others, through  the discipline of Action, i.e., Karmayoga. (24)",
          "Other dull-witted persons, however, not knowing  thus, worship even as they have heard from others  i.e., the knowers of truth; and even those who are thus  devoted to what they have heard, are able to cross the  ocean of mundane existence in the shape of death.(25)",
          "Arjuna, whatsoever being, the moving or unmoving,  is born, know it as emanated through the union  of Ksetra (Matter) and the Ksetrajna (Spirit). (26)",
          "He alone truly sees, who sees the supreme Lord   as imperishable and abiding equally in all perishable  beings, both animate and inanimate. (27)",
          "For, by seeing the Supreme Lord equally present  in all, he does not kill the Self by himself, and  thereby attains the supreme state. (28)",
          "He who sees that all actions are performed in  everyway by nature (Prakrti) and the Self as the  non-doer, he alone verily sees. (29)",
          "The moment man perceives the diversified  existence of beings as rooted in the one supreme  Spirit, and the spreading forth of all beings from the  same, that very moment he attains Brahma ( who is  Truth, Consciousness and Bliss solidified). (30)",
          "Arjuna, being without beginning and without  attributes, this indestructible supreme Spirit, though  dwelling in the body, in fact does nothing, nor  gets tainted. (31)",
          "As the all-pervading ether is not contaminated  by reason of its subtlety, though permeating the  body, the Self is not affected by the attributes of  the body due to Its attributeless character. (32)",
          "Arjuna, as the one_ sun illumines this entire  universe, so the one Atma (Spirit) illumines the  whole Ksetra (Field). (33)",
          "Those who thus perceive with the eye of  wisdom, the difference between the Ksetra and  Ksetrajna, and the phenomenon of liberation  from Prakrti with her evolutes, reach the supreme  eternal Spirit. (34)"

          "Sri Bhagavan said : I shall expound once more  the supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge,  acquiring which all sages have attained highest  perfection, being liberated from this mundane  existence. (1)",
          "Those who, by practising this knowledge have  entered into My being, are not born again at the  cosmic dawn, nor feel disturbed even during the  cosmic dissolution (Pralaya). (2)",
          "My primordial Nature, known as the great  Brahma, is the womb of all creatures; in that womb  I place the seed of all life. The creation of all  beings follows from that union of Matter and Spirit,  O Arjuna. (3)",
          "Of all embodied beings that appear in all the  species of various kinds, Arjuna, Prakrti or Nature  is the conceiving Mother, while I am the seed¬  giving Father. (4)",
          "Sattva. Rajas and Tamas—these three Gunas  born of Nature tie down the imperishable soul to  the body, Arjuna. (5)",
          "Of these, Sattva being immaculate, is illuminating  and flawless, Arjuna; it binds through attachment  to happiness and knowledge. (6)",
          "Arjuna, know the quality of Rajas, which is of  the nature of passion, as born of desire and  attachment. It binds the soul through attachment  to actions and their fruit. (7)",
          "And know Tamas, the deluder of all those who look upon the body as their own self, as born of  ignorance. It binds the soul through error, sleep  and sloth, Arjuna. (8)",
          "Sattva draws one to joy and Rajas to action;  while Tamas, clouding wisdom, impels one to error,  sleep and sloth Arjuna. (9)",
          "Overpowering Rajas and Tamas, Arjuna, Sattva  prevails; overpowering Sattva and Tamas, Rajas  prevails; even so, overpowering Sattva and Rajas,  Tamas prevails. (10)",
          "When light and discernment dawn in this body,  as well as in the mind and senses, then one should  know that Sattva is predominant. (11)",
          "With the preponderance of Rajas, Arjuna, greed,  activity, undertaking of action with an interested  motive, restlessness and a thirst for enjoyment make  their appearance. (12)",
          "With the growth of Tamas, Arjuna, obtuseness  of the mind and senses, disinclination to perform  one’s obligatory duties, frivolity and stupor—all  these appear. (13)",
          "When a man dies during the preponderance of  Sattva, he obtains the stainless ethereal worlds  (heaven etc.,) attained by men of noble deeds.(14)",
          "Dying when Rajas predominates, he is born  among those attached to action; even so, the man  who has expired during the preponderance of Tamas  is reborn in the species of the deluded creatures  such as insects and beasts etc. (15)",
          "The reward of a righteous act, they say, is  Sattvika i.e., faultless in the form of joy, wisdom  and dispassion etc., sorrow is declared to be the  fruit of a Rajasika act and ignorance, the fruit of  a Tamasika act. (16)",
          "Wisdom follows from Sattva, and greed,  undoubtedly, from Rajas; likewise, obstinate error,  stupor and also ignorance follow from Tamas. (17)",
          "Those who abide in the quality of Sattva wend  their way upwards; while those of a Rajasika  disposition stay in the middle. And those of a  Tamasika temperament, enveloped as they are in  the effects of Tamoguna, sink down. (18)",
          "When the discerning person sees no one as  doer other than the three Gunas, and realizes Me,  the supreme Spirit standing entirely beyond these  Gunas, he enters into My being. (19)",
          "Having transcended the aforesaid three Gunas,  which have caused the body, and freed from birth,  death, old age and all kinds of sorrow, the  embodied soul attains supreme bliss. (20)",
          "Arjuna said : What are the marks of him who      has risen above the three Gunas, and what is his  conduct ? And how. Lord, does he rise above the  three Gunas? (21)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: Arjuna, he who abhorsh  not illumination (which is bom of Sattva) and  activity (which is born of Rajas) and even stupor  (which is born of Tamas), when prevalent, nor  longs for them when they have ceased. (22)",
          "He who, sitting like a witness, is not disturbed  by the Gunas, and who, knowing that the Gunas  alone move among the Gunas, remains established  in identity with God, and never falls off from  that state. (23)",
          "He who is ever established in the Self, takes  pain and pleasure alike, regards a clod of earth,  a stone and a piece of gold as equal in value, is  possessed of wisdom, accepts the pleasant as well  as the unpleasant in the same spirit, and views  censure and praise alike. (24)",
          "He who is equipoised in honour or ignominy,  is alike towards a friend or an enemy, and has  renounced the sense of doership in all undertakings,  is said to have risen above the three Gunas.(25)",
          "He too who, constantly worships Me through  the Yoga of exclusive devotion—transcending  these three Gunas, he becomes eligible for attaining  Brahma. (26)",
          "For, I am the substratum of the imperishable  Brahma, of immortality, of the eternal Dharma and  of unending immutable bliss. (27)"

(1)",
          "Fed by the three Gunas and having sense-objects  for their tender leaves, the branches of the aforesaid  tree (in the shape of the different orders of creation)  extend both downwards and upwards; and its roots,  which bind the soul according to its actions in  the human body, are spread in all regions, higher  as well as lower. (2)",
          "The nature of this tree of creation, does not on  mature thought, turn out what it is represented to  be; for it has neither beginning nor end, nor even  stability. Therefore, cutting down this PTpala tree,  which is most firmly rooted, with the formidable  axe of dispassion. (3)",
          "Thereafter a man should diligently seek for that  supreme state, viz., God, having attained which  they return no more to this world; and having  fully resolved that he stands dedicated to  that Primeval Being (God Narayana) Himself,  from whom the flow of this beginningless creation  has progressed, he should dwell and meditate  on Him. (4)",
          "They who are free from pride and delusion,  who have conquered the evil of attachment, and  are constantly abiding in God, whose cravings  have altogether ceased and who are completely  immune to all pairs of opposites going by the  names of pleasure and pain, and are undeluded,  attain that supreme immortal state. (5)",

          "The eternal JTvatma in this body is a fragment  of My own Self; and it is that alone which draws  around itself the mind and the five senses, which  abide in Prakrti. (7)",
          "Even as the wind wafts scents from their seat,  so, too, the JTvatma, which is the controller of the  body etc., taking the mind and the senses from  the body which it leaves behind, forthwith migrates  to the body which it acquires. (8)",
          "It is while dwelling in the senses of hearing, sight,  touch, taste and smell, as well as in the mind, that  this JTvatma enjoys the objects of senses. (9)",
          "The ignorant know not the soul departing from,  or dwelling in the body, or enjoying the objects  of senses, i.e., even when it is connected with the  three Gunas; only those endowed with the eyes  of wisdom are able to realize it. (10)",
          "Striving Yogis too are able to realise this Self  enshrined in their heart. The ignorant, however,  whose heart has not been purified, know not this  Self in spite of their best endeavours. (11)",

Again, I am the only  object worth knowing through the Vedas; I alone  am the origin of Vedanta and the knower of the  Vedas too. (15)",

          "Arjuna said: Those, endowed with faith, who  worship gods and others, disregarding the   injunctions of the scriptures, where do they stand,  Krsna—in Sattva, Rajas or Tamas? (1)",
          "Sri Bhagavan said: That untutored innate faith  of men is of three kinds—Sattvika, Rajasika and  Tamasika. Hear of it from Me. (2)",
          "The faith of all men conforms to their mental  disposition, Arjuna. Faith constitutes a man;  whatever the nature of his faith, verily he is  that. (3)",
          "Men of Sattvika disposition worship gods;  those of Rajasika temperament worship demigods,  the demons; while others, who are of Tamasika  disposition, worship the spirits of the dead and  ghosts. (4)",
          "Men who practise severe penance of an arbitrary  type, not sanctioned by the scriptures, and who  are full of hypocrisy and egotism and are obsessed  with desire, attachment and pride of power; (5)",
          "And who emaciate the elements constituting  their body as well as Me, the Supreme Spirit,  dwelling in their heart—know those senseless  people to have a demoniac disposition. (6)",
          "Food also, which is agreeable to different men  according to their innate disposition is of three  kinds. And, likewise, sacrifice, penance and charity too are of three kinds each; hear their distinction  as follows. (7)",
          "Foods which promote longevity, intelligence,  vigour, health, happiness and cheerfulness, and  which are juicy, succulent, substantial and naturally  agreeable, are liked by men of Sattvika  nature. (8)",
          "Foods which are bitter, sour, salty, overhot,  pungent, dry and burning, and which cause  suffering, grief and sickness, are dear to the  Rajasika. (9)",
          "Food which is ill-cooked or not fully  ripe, insipid, putrid, stale and polluted, and which  is impure too, is dear to men of Tamasika  disposition. (10)",
          "The sacrifice which is offered, as ordained by scriptural injunctions, by men who expect no return  and who believe that such sacrifices must be  performed, is Sattvika in character. (11)",
          "That sacrifice, however, which is offered for  the sake of mere show or even with an eye to its  fruit, know it to be Rajasika, Arjuna. (12)",
          "A sacrifice, which is not in conformity with  scriptural injunctions, in which no food is offered,  and no sacrificial fees are paid, which is without  sacred chant of hymns and devoid of faith, is said  to be Tamasika. (13)",
          "Worship of gods, the Brahmanas, one’s guru, elders and great soul, purity, straightforwardness,  continence and non-violence—these are called  penance of the body. (14)",
          "Words which cause no annoyance to others  and are truthful, agreeable and beneficial, as well as the study of the Vedas and other Sastras and  the practice of the chanting of Divine Name—  this is known as penance of speech. (15)",
          "Cheerfulness of mind, placidity, habit of  contemplation on God, control of the mind and  perfect purity of inner feelings—all this is called  austerity of the mind. (16)",
          "This threefold penance performed with supreme  faith by Yogis expecting no return is called  Sattvika. (17)",
          "The austerity which is performed for the sake  of renown, honour or adoration, as well as for any  other selfish gain, either in all sincerity or by way  of ostentation, and yields an uncertain and  momentary fruit, has been spoken of here as  Rajasika. (18)",
          "Penance which is resorted to out of foolish  obstinacy and is accompanied by self-mortification,  or is intended to harm others, such penance has  been declared as Tamasika. (19)",
          "A gift which is bestowed with a sense of duty  on one from whom no return is expected,  at appropriate time and place, and to a  deserving person, that gift has been declared as  Sattvika. (20)",
          "A gift which is bestowed in a grudging spirit  and with the object of getting a service in return  or in the hope of obtaining a reward, is called  Rajasika. (21)",
          "A gift which is made without good grace and in  a disdainful spirit, out of time and place, and to  undeserving persons, is said to be Tamasika. (22)",
          "OM, TAT and SAT—this has been declared as  the triple appellation of Brahma, who is Truth,  Consciousness and Bliss. By that were the  Brahmanas and the Vedas as well as sacrifices  created at the cosmic dawn. (23)",
          "Therefore, acts of sacrifice, charity and austerity,  as enjoined by sacred precepts, are always  commenced by noble persons, used to the recitation  of Vedic chants, with the invocation of the divine  name ‘OM’. (24)",
          "With the idea that all this belongs to God, who  is denoted by the appellation ‘TAT’, acts of  sacrifice and austerity as well as acts of charity  of various kinds, are performed by the seekers of  liberation, expecting no return for them. (25)",
          "The name of God, ‘SAT’, is used in the sense  of reality and goodness. And the word ‘SAT’ is  also used in the sense of a praiseworthy, auspicious  action, Arjuna. (26)",
          "And steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and  charity is likewise spoken of as ‘SAT’ and action  for the sake of God is verily termed as ‘SAT’. (27)",
          "An oblation which is offered, a gift given, an  austerity practised, and whatever good deed is  performed, if it is without faith, it is termed as  naught i.e., ‘asat’; therefore, it is of no avail here  or hereafter. (28)"

          "Sri Bhagavan said: Some sages understand  Samnyasa as the giving up of all actions motivated  by desire; and the wise declare that Tyaga consists  in relinquishing the fruit of all actions. (2)",
          "Some wise men declare that all actions contain  a measure of evil, and are, therefore, worth giving  up; while others say that acts of sacrifice, charity  and penance are not to be shunned. (3)",
          "Of Samnyasa and Tyaga, first hear My   conclusion on the subject of renunciation (Tyaga),  Arjuna; for renunciation, O tiger among men, has  been declared to be of three kinds—Sattvika,   Rajasika and Tamasika. (4)",
          "Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not  worth giving up; they must be performed. For   sacrifice, charity and penance—all these are   purifiers to the wise men. (5)",
          "Hence these acts of sacrifice, charity and  penance, and all other acts of duty too, must be  performed without attachment and expectation of  reward : this is My well-considered and supreme  verdict, Arjuna. (6)",
          "(Prohibited acts and those that are motivated  by desire should, no doubt, be given up). But it  is not advisable to abandon a prescribed duty.  Such abandonment out of ignorance has been  declared as Tamasika. (7)",
          "Should anyone give up his duties for fear of  physical strain, thinking that all actions are verily  painful—practising such Rajasika form of  renunciation, he does not reap the fruit of  renunciation. (8)",
          "A prescribed duty which is performed simply  because it has to be performed, giving up  attachment and fruit, that alone has been  recognized as the Sattvika form of renunciation.(9)",
          "He who has neither aversion for action which  is leading to bondage (3Hjyiet) nor attachment to  that which is conducive to blessedness (jyiei)—  imbued with the quality of goodness, he has all  his doubts resolved, is intelligent and a man of  true renunciation. (10)",
          "Since all actions cannot be given up in their  entirety by anyone possessing a body, he alone  who renounces the fruit of actions is called a man  of renunciation. (11)",
          "Agreeable, disagreeable and mixed—threefold,  indeed, is the fruit that accrues after death from  the actions of the unrenouncing. But there is none  whatsoever for those who have renounced. (12)",
          "In the branch of learning known as Sankhya,  which prescribes means for neutralizing all actions,  the five factors have been mentioned as  contributory to the accomplishment of all actions;  know them all from Me, Arjuna. (13)",
          "The following are the factors operating towards  the accomplishment of actions, viz., the body and  the doer, the organs of different kinds and the  different functions of manifold kinds; and the fifth  is Daiva, latencies of past actions. (14)",
          "These five are the contributory causes of  whatever actions, prescribed or prohibited, man  performs with the mind, speech and body.(15)",
          "Notwithstanding this, however, he who, having  an impure mind, regards the absolute, taintless  Self alone as the doer, that man of perverse  understanding does not view aright. (16)",
          "He whose mind is free from the sense of doership,  and whose reason is not affected by worldly objects  and activities, does not really kill, even having  killed all these people, nor does any sin accrue  to him. (17)",
          "The Knower, knowledge and the object of  knowledge—these three motivate action. Even so,  the doer, the organs and activity—these are the  three constituents of action. (18)",
          "In the branch of knowledge dealing with the  Gunas or modes of Prakrti. knowledge and action  as well as the doer have been declared to be of  three kinds according to the Guna which predo¬  minates in each; hear them too duly from Me. (19)",
          "That by which man perceives one imperishable divine existence as undivided and equally present  in all individual beings, know that knowledge to be Sattvika. (20)",
          "The knowledge by which man cognizes many  existences of various kinds, as apart from one  another, in all beings, know that knowledge to  be Rajasika. (21)",
          "Again, that knowledge which clings to one   body as if it were the whole, and which is irrational,  has no real grasp of truth and is trivial, has been  declared as Tamasika. (22)",
          "That action which is ordained by the scriptures  and is not accompanied by the sense of doership,  and has been done without any attachment or  aversion by one who seeks no return, is called  Sattvika. (23)",
          "That action, however, which involves much  strain and is performed by one who seeks   enjoyments or by a man full of egotism, has been  spoken of as Rajasika. (24)",
          "That action which is undertaken through sheer  ignorance, without regard to consequences or loss  to oneself, injury to others and one’s own  resourcefulness, is declared as Tamasika. (25)",
          "Free from attachment, unegoistic, endowed with  firmness and zeal and unswayed by success and  failure—such a doer is said to be Sattvika.(26)",
          "The doer who is full of attachment, seeks the  fruit of actions and is greedy, and who is oppressive  by nature and of impure conduct, and who feels  joy and sorrow, has been called Rajasika.(27)",
          "Lacking piety and self-control, uncultured,  arrogant, deceitful, inclined to rob others of their  livelihood, slothful, despondent and procrasti¬  nating—such a doer is called Tamasika. (28)",
          "Now hear, Arjuna, the threefold divison,  based on the predominance of each Guna, of    understanding (Buddhi) and firmness (Dhrti), which  I shall explain in detail, one by one. (29)",
          "The intellect which correctly determines the paths  of activity and renunciation, what ought to be  done and what should not be done, what is fear  and what is fearlessness, and what is bondage and  what is liberation, that intellect is Sattvika.(30)",
          "The intellect by which man does not truly  perceive what is Dharma and what is Adharma,  what ought to be done and what should not be  done—that intellect is Rajasika. (31)",
          "The intellect wrapped in ignorance, which  imagines even Adharma to be Dharma, and sees  all other things upside-down—that intellect is  Tamasika, Arjuna. (32)",
          "The unwavering perseverance by which man  controls through the Yoga of meditation the  functions of the mind, the vital airs and the senses—  that firmness, Arjuna, is Sattvika. (33)",
          "The perseverance (Dhrti), however, by which  the man seeking reward for his actions clutches  with extreme fondness virtues, earthly possessions  and worldly enjoyments—that persevrance (Dhrti)  is said to be Rajasika, Arjuna. (34)",
          "The perseverance (Dhrti) by which an evil-  minded person does not give up sleep, fear, anxiety,  sorrow and vanity as well, that perseverance is  Tamasika.(35)",
          "Now hear from Me the threefold joy too. That  in which the striver finds enjoyment through  practice of adoration, meditation and service to  God etc., and whereby he reaches the end of  sorrow (36)",
          "such a joy, though appearing as poison  in the beginning, tastes like nectar in the end;  hence that joy, born as it is of the placidity of  mind brought about by meditation on God, has  been declared as Sattvika. (37)",
          "The delight which ensues from the contact of  the senses with their objects is eventually poison¬  like, though appearing at first as nectar; hence it  has been spoken of as Rajasika. (38)",
          "That which stupefies the Self during its  enjoyment as well as in the end—derived from  sleep, indolence and obstinate error, such delight  has been called Tamasika. (39)",
          "There is no being on earth, or in the middle region or  even among the gods or anywhere else, who is  free from these three Gunas, born of Prakrti. (40)",
          "The duties of the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas  and the Vaisyas, as well as of the Sudras have  been assigned according to their innate modes of  Prakrti (Gunas), Arjuna. (41)",
          "Subjugation of the mind and senses, enduring  hardships for the discharge of one’s sacred  obligations, external and internal purity, forgiving  the faults of others, straightness of mind, senses and behaviour, belief in the Vedas and other  scriptures, God and life after death etc., study and  teaching of the Vedas and other scriptures and  realization of the truth relating to God—all these  constitute the natural duties of a Brahmana.(42)",
          "Heroism, majesty, firmness, diligence and  dauntlessness in battle, bestowing gifts, and  lordliness—all these constitute the natural duty  of a Ksatriya. (43)",
          "Agriculture, rearing of cows and honest  exchange of merchandise—these constitute the  natural duty of a Vaisya (a member of the trading  class); and service of the other classes is the  natural duty even of a Sudra (a member of the  labouring class). (44)",
          "Keenly devoted to his own natural duty, man  attains the highest perfection in the form of God-  realization. Hear the mode of performance whereby  the man engaged in his inborn duty reaches that  highest consummation. (45)",
          "From whom all beings come into being and  by whom the whole universe is pervaded, by  worshipping Him through the performance of his  own natural duties, man attains the highest  perfection. (46)",
          "Better is one’s own duty, though devoid of  merit, than the duty of another well-performed;  for. performing the duty ordained by his own  nature, man does not incur sin. (47)",
          "Therefore, Arjuna, one should not relinquish  one’s innate duty, even though it has a measure  of evil; for all undertakings are beset by some  evil, as is the fire covered by smoke. (48)",
          "He whose intellect is unattached everywhere,  whose thirst for enjoyment has altogether  disappeared and who has subdued his mind, reaches  through Saiikhyayoga (the path of Knowledge)  the consummation of actionlessness. (49)",
          "Arjuna, know from Me only briefly the process through which man having attained actionlessness,  which is the highest consummation of Jnanayoga  (the path of Knowledge), reaches Brahma. (50)",
          "",
          "Endowed with a pure intellect and partaking  of a light, Sattvika and regulated diet, living  in a lonely and undefiled place, having rejected  sound and other objects of sense, having controlled  the mind, speech and body by restraining the  mind and senses through firmness of a Sattvika  type, taking a resolute stand on dispassion,  after having completely got rid of attraction   and aversion and remaining ever devoted to  the Yoga of meditation(51-52)",
          "Having given up egotism,  violence, arrogance, lust, anger and luxuries,  devoid of the feeling of meum and tranquil  of heart—such a man becomes qualified for  oneness with Brahma, who is Truth, Consciousness  and Bliss. (53)",
          "Established in identity with Brahma (who is  Truth, Consciousness and Bliss solidified), and cheerful in mind, the SankhyayogI no longer  grieves nor craves for anything. The same to all  beings, such a Yogi attains supreme devotion to  Me. (54)",
          "Through that supreme devotion he comes to  know Me in reality, what and who I am; and  thereby knowing Me truly, he forthwith merges  into My being. (55)",
          "The KarmayogT, however, who depends on Me,  attains by My grace the eternal, imperishable state,  even though performing all actions. (56)",
          "Mentally dedicating all your actions to Me,  and taking recourse to Yoga in the form of even¬  mindedness, be solely devoted to Me and  constantly fix your mind on Me. (57)",
          "With your mind thus devoted to Me, you shall,  by My grace overcome all difficulties. But, if from  self-conceit you do not care to listen to Me, you  will be lost. (58)",
          "If. taking your stand on egotism, you think, “I  will not fight,” vain is this resolve of yours; nature  will drive you to the act. (59)",
          "That action, too, which you are not willing to  undertake through ignorance you will perforce  perform, bound by your own duty born of your   nature. (60)",
          "Arjuna, God abides in the heart of all creatures,  causing them to revolve according to their Karma  by His illusive power (Maya) as though mounted  on a machine. (61)",
          "Take refuge in Him alone with all your being,  Arjuna. By His mere grace you will attain supreme  peace and the eternal abode. (62)",
          "Thus, has this wisdom, the most profound secret  of all secret knowledge, been imparted to you by Me;  deeply pondering over it, now do as you like. (63)",
          "Hear, again, My supremely profound words,  the most esoteric of all truths; as you are extremely  dear to Me, therefore, I shall give you this salutary  advice for your own good. (64)",
          "Give your mind to Me, be devoted to Me,  worship Me and bow to Me. Doing so, you will  come to Me alone, I truly promise you; for, you  are exceptionally dear to Me. (65)",
          "Resigning all your duties to Me, the all-powerful  and all supporting Lord, take refuge in Me alone;  I shall absolve you of all sins, worry not. (66)",
          "This secret gospel of the Gita should never be  imparted to a man who lacks in austerity, nor to  him who is wanting in devotion, nor even to him  who is not willing to hear; and in no case to him  who finds fault with Me. (67)",
          "He who, offering the highest love to Me,  preaches the most profound gospel of the Gita  among My devotees, shall come to Me alone;  there is no doubt about it. (68)",
          "Among men there is none who does Me a more  loving service than he; nor shall anyone be dearer  to Me on the entire globe than he. (69)",
          "Whosoever studies this sacred dialogue of ours  in the form of the Gita, by him too shall I be  worshipped with Yajna of Knowledge; such is My  conviction. (70)",
          "The man who listens to the holy Gita with  reverence, being free from malice, he too, liberated  from sin, shall reach the propitious worlds of the  virtuous. (71)",
          "Have you, O Arjuna, heard this gospel of the Gita attentively? And has your delusion born of  ignorance been destroyed, O Dhananjaya, conqueror  of riches? (72)",
          "Arjuna said: Krsna, by Your grace my delusion  has been destroyed and I have gained wisdom. I  am free of all doubt. I will do your bidding.(73)",
          "Sanjaya said: Thus I heard the mysterious and  thrilling conversation between Sri Krsna and the  high-souled Arjuna, son of Kuntl. (74)",
          "Having been blessed with the divine vision  by the grace of Sri Vyasa, I heard in person this  supremely esoteric gospel from the Lord of Yoga,  Sri Krsna Himself, imparting it to Arjuna. (75)",
          "Remembering, over and over, that sacred and mystic conversation between Bhagavan Sri Krsna  and Arjuna, O King! I am thrilled again and  yet again. (76)",
          "Remembering also, again and again, that most  wonderful form of Sri Krsna, great is my wonder  and I am thrilled over and over again. (77)",
          "Wherever there is Bhagavan Sri Krsna, the Lord  of Yoga, and wherever there is Arjuna, the wielder  of the Gandlva bow, goodness, victory, glory and  unfailing righteousness will surely be there : such  is My conviction. (78)"
